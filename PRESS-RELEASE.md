Sentiment.ly

Twitter users analyzed, using the brains of IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer

We live in a digital age - and so much of our communication is no longer face-to-face but instead mediated by screens, smartphones, web services and more. Most of us have experienced a situation where a text message or social media post was perceived differently by different people - and at times even interpreted as having the opposite sentiment from the one the author intended.

Wouldn't it be great if there were a web app where you could "test drive" a social media post or text message and have IBM Watson's powerful sentiment analysis tool tell you how that text is likely to be perceived?

Enter Sentiment.ly!

And many of us use social media to check someone out before meeting them or to do initial research on what someone is like. What does this person tweet about, whom do they follow, what are their interests and how do they portray themselves in their profile?

Wouldn't you love it if you could run someone's tweets through Watson and find out how their expressed sentiments will ACTUALLY be perceived?

Sentiment.ly is your tool!

Anyone who wants to run these kinds of queries can use Sentiment.ly to see the results - displayed nicely in a colorful graph - and explore the potential.

Sentiment.ly uses an intuitive and fun interface - a single page web app - to allow its users to:

- enter a Twitter handle and see a graph of results from Watson's Tone Analyzer, based on the user's last 50 tweets

- type a phrase or sentence and receive the same analysis for text that you want to "test drive"

- click on any previously-run search and bring that analysis back to the screen

- view the Twitter profile picture and read the profile details for any search you run

- compare the tone of various people's tweets, as well as how that tone may change over time

"What I love most about Sentiment.ly is the fact that in a few seconds I can get a powerful analysis of the tone in the the public tweets of any one of 320 million+ monthly Twitter users," said John Packel, a Sentiment.ly developer and its product owner. "It's fun to compare people I follow - and even pit tweeters against each other based on how they score on 13 different measures of emotional, language and social sentiments."

All one needs to do to feel the power of Sentiment.ly is go to bit.do/vtak (short for the developer team, "Vue.js to a Kill"), type in a Twitter handle or a phrase in one of the two boxes and hit "submit".

"The way you get a better world is, you don’t put up with substandard anything. Test drive your social posts with Sentiment.ly before you put them out into the world.”
   - Joe Strummer, singer, lyricist and guitar player in the seminal punk rock band The Clash

Tone Analyzer uses linguistic analysis to detect three types of tones in written text: emotions, social tendencies, and writing style. Use the Tone Analyzer service to understand emotional context of conversations and communications.
